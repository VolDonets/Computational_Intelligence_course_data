# Task for example 1
1. Run a few examples with different number of 3D points, look at path optimization. (Take 50, 100 and 200 points)
2. Play around with algorithm hyperparameters.


# Task for example 2
1. Find a weighted graph (like search for image in google) -> present it as `nx.DiGraph()`
2. Play around with algorithm hyperparameters.

# Play with parameters (set up some parameters and see what a result), screenshot is enough
